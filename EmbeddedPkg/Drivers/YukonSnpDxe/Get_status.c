/**
  Reads the current interrupt status and recycled transmit buffer status from a
  network interface.

  This function gets the current interrupt and recycled transmit buffer status
  from the network interface. The interrupt status is returned as a bit mask in
  InterruptStatus. If InterruptStatus is NULL, the interrupt status will not be
  read. If TxBuf is not NULL, a recycled transmit buffer address will be retrieved.
  If a recycled transmit buffer address is returned in TxBuf, then the buffer has
  been successfully transmitted, and the status for that buffer is cleared. If
  the status of the network interface is successfully collected, EFI_SUCCESS
  will be returned. If the driver has not been initialized, EFI_DEVICE_ERROR will
  be returned.

  @param This            A pointer to the EFI_SIMPLE_NETWORK_PROTOCOL instance.
  @param InterruptStatus A pointer to the bit mask of the currently active
                         interrupts (see "Related Definitions"). If this is NULL,
                         the interrupt status will not be read from the device.
                         If this is not NULL, the interrupt status will be read
                         from the device. When the interrupt status is read, it
                         will also be cleared. Clearing the transmit interrupt does
                         not empty the recycled transmit buffer array.
  @param TxBuf           Recycled transmit buffer address. The network interface
                         will not transmit if its internal recycled transmit
                         buffer array is full. Reading the transmit buffer does
                         not clear the transmit interrupt. If this is NULL, then
                         the transmit buffer status will not be read. If there
                         are no transmit buffers to recycle and TxBuf is not NULL,
                         TxBuf will be set to NULL.

  @retval EFI_SUCCESS           The status of the network interface was retrieved.
  @retval EFI_NOT_STARTED       The network interface has not been started.
  @retval EFI_INVALID_PARAMETER This parameter was NULL or did not point to a valid
                                EFI_SIMPLE_NETWORK_PROTOCOL structure.
  @retval EFI_DEVICE_ERROR      The command could not be sent to the network
                                interface.
