/**
  Performs read and write operations on the NVRAM device attached to a network
  interface.

  This function performs read and write operations on the NVRAM device attached
  to a network interface. If ReadWrite is TRUE, a read operation is performed.
  If ReadWrite is FALSE, a write operation is performed. Offset specifies the
  byte offset at which to start either operation. Offset must be a multiple of
  NvRamAccessSize , and it must have a value between zero and NvRamSize.
  BufferSize specifies the length of the read or write operation. BufferSize must
  also be a multiple of NvRamAccessSize, and Offset + BufferSize must not exceed
  NvRamSize.
  If any of the above conditions is not met, then EFI_INVALID_PARAMETER will be
  returned.
  If all the conditions are met and the operation is "read," the NVRAM device
  attached to the network interface will be read into Buffer and EFI_SUCCESS
  will be returned. If this is a write operation, the contents of Buffer will be
  used to update the contents of the NVRAM device attached to the network
  interface and EFI_SUCCESS will be returned.

  It does the basic checking on the input parameters and retrieves snp structure
  and then calls the read_nvdata() call which does the actual reading

  @param This       A pointer to the EFI_SIMPLE_NETWORK_PROTOCOL instance.
  @param ReadWrite  TRUE for read operations, FALSE for write operations.
  @param Offset     Byte offset in the NVRAM device at which to start the read or
                    write operation. This must be a multiple of NvRamAccessSize
                    and less than NvRamSize. (See EFI_SIMPLE_NETWORK_MODE)
  @param BufferSize The number of bytes to read or write from the NVRAM device.
                    This must also be a multiple of NvramAccessSize.
  @param Buffer     A pointer to the data buffer.

  @retval EFI_SUCCESS           The NVRAM access was performed.
  @retval EFI_NOT_STARTED       The network interface has not been started.
  @retval EFI_INVALID_PARAMETER One or more of the following conditions is TRUE:
                                * The This parameter is NULL
                                * The This parameter does not point to a valid
                                  EFI_SIMPLE_NETWORK_PROTOCOL  structure
                                * The Offset parameter is not a multiple of
                                  EFI_SIMPLE_NETWORK_MODE.NvRamAccessSize
                                * The Offset parameter is not less than
                                  EFI_SIMPLE_NETWORK_MODE.NvRamSize
                                * The BufferSize parameter is not a multiple of
                                  EFI_SIMPLE_NETWORK_MODE.NvRamAccessSize
                                * The Buffer parameter is NULL
  @retval EFI_DEVICE_ERROR      The command could not be sent to the network
                                interface.
  @retval EFI_UNSUPPORTED       This function is not supported by the network
                                interface.
